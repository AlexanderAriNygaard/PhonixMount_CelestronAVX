## 👨🏻‍🏫 The Inspiration Behind The Project

Embark with me on a journey as I attempt an embedded firmware project to bring my derelict Celestron AVX mount back to life — rebuilding custom motor control, position feedback, and tracking logic from the ground up.

The Story

As a kid, I was endlessly fascinated by space and science. When I was 16, my father bought me my first telescope — a modest manually controlled Celestron refractor that was really only good for viewing the Moon and a few of the brighter planets. But that was enough to hook me instantly.

Within a week of seeing me spend every night outside staring at the sky, my dad surprised me with a Celestron C8 on an automated AVX mount — a setup that could point to over 50,000 objects across the night sky. For the next four years, I captured photos of the stars, exploring every corner of the northern hemisphere I could, through freezing winters and mosquito-filled summer nights alike.

Then one evening, just as I was really finding my stride with astrophotography, the AVX mount stopped responding. My cosmic adventures came to an abrupt halt. I was in university at the time, so I packed it away and assumed my stargazing days were over.

Fast forward twelve years — I’m now a senior software engineer and systems architect at General Motors. While cleaning out my old room one day, I came across that same telescope, gathering dust. Seeing it again brought back all those late nights under the stars with my dad — and all the curiosity that started me down the path to engineering in the first place.

So here I am, determined to restore that mount and breathe new life into it — learning, hacking, and experimenting as I go. Along the way, I’ll be designing new control electronics, writing custom firmware, and documenting the process here.

If you’ve found your way to this repository, I hope it inspires you to tinker, rebuild, and explore your own curiosities — no matter how long something’s been sitting idle.

Never stop learning. Never stop exploring.
